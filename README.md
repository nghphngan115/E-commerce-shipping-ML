# E-commerce-shipping-ML
## Project Overview
This project analyzes shipment activities in an e-commerce company to identify factors contributing to late deliveries and to predict on-time deliveries using various machine learning models. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes features such as mode of shipment, customer ratings, product importance, and more.
## Details
The project begins with a detailed Data Overview, providing a description of the dataset, its features, and a summary of data types, confirming that there are no missing values. This is followed by Data Pre-Processing, which involves cleaning and preparing the data, including label encoding of categorical variables to ensure compatibility with machine learning models. In the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, various visualizations and insights are generated, such as examining the correlation between discounts offered and delivery times, as well as analyzing patterns in late deliveries. The Model Building and Evaluation section includes the implementation of several machine learning modelsâ€”Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. These models are evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy, with SMOTE being applied to address class imbalance and improve model performance.
